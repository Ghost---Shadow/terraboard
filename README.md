# Terraform Board (WIP)

Inspired by [tensorboard](https://www.tensorflow.org/images/graph_vis_animation.gif). Terraform Board is a visualizer and IDE for terraform.

Not to be confused with [terraboard](https://github.com/camptocamp/terraboard)

Here is the visualization of [terraform-aws-vault](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-aws-vault) as an example.

2. Do `npm i -g terraform-board`
3. In your terraform repository run `terraform-board`
4. Open your browser to `localhost:3001`

## Roadmap
* Interactive visualization
* Sidebar with details

* Plan and apply visualization
